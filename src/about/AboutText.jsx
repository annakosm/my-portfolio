            Hey there! I’m a passionate web developer who loves turning ideas into reality through
            code. Currently, I work as a <strong>backend developer</strong> with <strong>Java and
            Spring Boot</strong>, building reliable and efficient systems.
            In my free time, I channel my creativity into designing and developing applications,
             projects that challenge me to learn, grow, and bring new concepts to life.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m inspired by two forces: the precision of problem-solving and the freedom of creation.
             Solving complex challenges satisfies my logical side, while building something meaningful
             fulfills my creative one. Together, they keep me curious, motivated, and constantly evolving 
             as a developer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even this app is one of those explorations, a reflection of my curiosity and passion for 
            building things.
        </p>
        <p>
            Welcome to my world! Where logic, creativity, and curiosity come together.✨
